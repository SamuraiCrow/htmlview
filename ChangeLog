  * mcc: ScrollGroup custom class was not created causing htmlview.mcc to crash.
    Also moved init functions after run_constructors() to make sure malloc() is
    available for new operator. The htmlview.mcc no longer crashes in MorphOS but
    does not function like original 68k version.

2007-03-14  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>
  * include/stubgen.pl: perl script (modified from cvinclude.pl from MorphOS SDK)
    to generate 68k vararg stubs for ppc. It is needed since gcc3/gcc4 compilers
    for MOS no longer support VARARGS68K.
  * mcc: demo app now works to some extent in MorphOS. Replaced VARARGS68K in
    TreeClass.cpp/BackUp() to standard version and reworked
    ImageManager.c/NewDecoderObject() to build with gcc4/mos.

2007-03-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/mcp: applied slightly modified patch kindly provided by Joerg
    Strohmayer. Now at least the HTMLview-Text app should run on AmigaOS4.

2007-03-13  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc: added constructors.c/.h and libnix.c to initialize constructors for
    libnix needed to build c++ classes. This required modification to mccheader.c
    because constructors/destructors should run only once in this kind of
    libraries.
  * mcc: now builds for MorphOS.
  * mcc/HTMLview-Test.c: now builds for MorphOS.
  * mcc: less warnings.

2007-03-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/#?: fixed a bunch of compiler warnings to get the MCC compiled more
    cleanly before we begin to hunt bugs.
  * mcc/mcp: replaced all GetAttrs()/get() uses with xget()

2007-03-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: disabling a debug flag was not possible due to a check for the
    '!' at a wrong index.

2007-03-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/mcp: fixed the incorrect GETINTERFACE() usages for the OS4 target and
    got the OS4 target compiled again.

2007-03-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc: got rid of the single target makefiles and added a more generalized
    'Makefile' which should fit for all supported target platforms. In addition,
    the MCC souces should now at least compile for AmigaOS4 - however the
    HTMLview-Test application still crashes and as such also the htmlview.mcc
    class. More work is required to get the class going, especially on all
    supported target platforms.
  * mcp: fixed all compiler warnings and adapted sources to cleanly compile
    for OS3 and MOS target as well.

2007-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * initial LGPL release published at sf.net. Please note that currently
    just the mcp compiles cleanly. The mcc sources still require a large
    amount of work to get compiled and running...

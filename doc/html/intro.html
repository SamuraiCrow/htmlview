    <font color="#000000"><br>
    HTMLview.mcc is a MUI class that will load, parse and display HTML formatted text. It provides MUI application programmers a gadget for viewing/displaying HTML pages. It comes with an
    object-oriented design, slim and tidy so that the HTML engine is capable of showing HTML very fast...<br></font>

    <font color="#000000"><br>
    The HTMLview.mcc MUI class authors are proud to announce that finally after 10 years of successful development on the AmigaOS platform, the full sources of the HTMLview.mcc MUI custom class are
    now released under the LGPL license.<br>
    <br>
    Since 2000 the sources were kinda lost because the original author (Allan
    Odgaard) suffered a harddisk crash. However, in early 2005 another try was started to recover the sources from that
    particular harddisk and luckily the full sources were salvaged from it.
    Therefore the sources are now released under the LGPL Open source license to 1. attract more developers to it and 2. to have
    "the internet" as the future backup server for it :)<br>
    <br>
    The sources are now hosted on a sourceforge.net SVN and every interested developer is invited to contribute to the development of the HTMLview.mcc class, especially for the upcoming efforts in
    AmigaOS4/MorphOS development.<br></font>

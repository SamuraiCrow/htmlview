  * mcp: fixed all compiler warnings and adapted sources to cleanly compile
    for OS3 and MOS target as well.

2007-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * initial LGPL release published at sf.net. Please note that currently
    just the mcp compiles cleanly. The mcc sources still require a large
    amount of work to get compiled and running...
